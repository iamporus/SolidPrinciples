# SOLID Principles by Uncle Bob

This repo serves as a reference to a series of technical sessions conducted on SOLID Principles
at my workplace. 

- **S**ingle Responsibility Principle
- **O**pen Close Principle
- **L**iskov Substitution Principle
- **I**nterface Segregation Principle
- **D**ependency Inversion Principle

Currently, the examples added are written using Java programming language. 
Anyone interested in contributing can fork and submit PR for other programming languages.

### Structure

- For explaining every principle, there's a separate package present in the repo with respective principle's title.
- The package contains a **_bad_** implementation of an use case, typically a mock or stub which doesn't follow the respective principle.
- Also, it has a modified **_good_** implementation of the same use case, which follows the respective principle.
- Every package has a dedicated README for explaining the principle as well as info about the use case described. 

### Note

- The code examples added here are not executable in nature and will never be that way in future.
- They only demonstrate scenarios to help understand the principles in more practical way.
